2021 February 8, 10, 15, & 17; 3-5PM

Sessions:

* Feb 8: Introduction to RNA-Seq, data quality check, data quality filtering, transcriptome assembly
* Feb 10: Mapping read to genome assembly, read counting
* Feb 15: Differential gene expression analysis and Visualization
* Feb 17: Differential gene expression analysis using Nextflow

Main lesson materials are in:
* [RNA-Seq.md](RNA-Seq.md) (work on cluster)
* [Nextflow.md](Nextflow.md)

The tutorials are specific to working on the OIST HPC, Deigo, but could be adapted for use on other systems.

Softwares used:

* FastQC v0.11.9: 
* MultiQC v1.9
* Trimmomatic v0.33
* Trinity v2.11.0
* Dammit v1.2
* STAR v2.7.7a
* HTSeq v0.13.5
